{"name":"REclipse","tagline":"Reactive Debugging - REdefined","body":"## Why Reactive Inspector?\r\nDebugging reactive software with a traditional debugger can be unnecessary complicated. We want to change that. With Reactive Inspector we give you the tools needed to debug your reactive software in a comfortable and powerful way.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n#### Reactive Tree\r\nThe reactive tree view lets you inspect variables, signals, events and their dependencies in a visualization of the dependency graph in your app. You can see the values of the individual nodes as they change over time and the tree provides you with visual cues when a significant event occurs, such as a value change or when an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n![Dependency Graph Visualization](http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/dependency-graph.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Tree Outline\r\nIn a big dependency graph it is sometimes hard to navigate in the reactive tree. This view shows you at a glance where you are in the graph and helps you jump quickly to a different portion of the graph.\r\n\r\n![Tree Outline](http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/tree-outline.png)\r\n\r\n#### Time Travel\r\nEver needed to go back to a particular step in your program to inspect your variables values at that point in time? Well, Reactive Inspector makes this possible. It records all the values of each signal or variable and allows you to travel back in time through all states of the dependency graph.\r\nThis video shows you how it works in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n<video src=“http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/Ente.mp4” controls />\r\n\r\nHistory Queries\r\n\r\n#### Reactive Breakpoints\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Time Profiling\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Node Search / Dependency Highlighting\r\n![Node search](http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/node-search.png)\r\n\r\n![Highlight dependents of a node](http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/highlight-dependencies-children.png)\r\n![Highlight dependencies of a node](http://eclipse.kaiengelhardt.com/eclipse-plugin/highlight-dependencies-ancestors.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported Platforms\r\n* IDE: Eclipse\r\n* Language: Scala v. 2.4.1 and later\r\n* RP Frameworks: [REScala](https://github.com/guidosalva/REScala)\r\n\r\n## Installation & Setup\r\n* Install and open Eclipse (the Scala IDE is recommended).\r\n* Help -> Install New Software...\r\n* Add the REclipse update site: https://dl.bintray.com/m1c3/generic\r\n* Select the just added REclipse update site from the drow-down.\r\n* Install the REclipse plugin from the Reactive Programming category.\r\n\r\n#### Create a new project\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a new project with Reactive Inspector support you can use the [REclipse Template](https://github.com/m1c3/reclipse-template) project as a starting point:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/m1c3/reclipse-template.git`\r\n\r\nThen you can import the project into Eclipse via sbt:\r\n\r\n* `sbt eclipse`\r\n* Eclipse: File -> Import...\r\n* Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace\r\n* Select the cloned template project.\r\n\r\n#### Use an existing REScala project with Reactive Inspector\r\n\r\nAdd the REScala Logger to the dependencies of the build.sbt:\r\n`\"de.tuda.stg.reclipse\" %% \"rescala-logger\" % \"0.1\"`\r\n\r\nAdd a resolver for the Reactive Inspector maven repository in the build.sbt:\r\n`resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo(\"m1c3\", \"maven\")`\r\n\r\nAttach the REScala Logger to REScala's logging in the main method of your application (or at a place before any Var, Signal or Event is created):\r\n```\r\nrescala.ReactiveEngine.log = new REScalaLogger\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n?\r\n\r\n## Reactive Inspector is a project started by Guido Salvaneschi the Software Technology Group - Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. \r\n* [Matthias Jahn](https://github.com/m1c3)\r\n* [Guido Salvaneshi](https://github.com/guidosalva)\r\n* [Sebastian Ruhleder](https://github.com/ruhleder)\r\n* [Kai Engelhardt](https://github.com/kaiengelhardt)\r\n* [Konstantin Sitnikov](https://github.com/KonstantinSitnikov)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
